    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper investigates how tax cut promotes firm investment and alleviates financing constrains. We exploit VAT reform starting from 2012 as exogenous shocks and uses listed companies to make fixed effect regression analysis. Our empirical evidences reveal that (1) turnover tax burden of enterprises decreased by 1%, the total investment of enterprises increased by 10.98%, net investment increased by 4.57%; (2) VAT reform significantly promoted the total investment of enterprises increased by 1.83%, net investment increased by 0.86%; (3) the promotion effect of tax cuts is more significant for small and medium-sized private enterprises with tighter financing constraints. This suggests that tax cuts can boost firm investment by easing corporate financing constraints.</div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Bringing up sons to support parents in their old age prevails in many developing country. By exploiting the incidence of first-born twins and regional and temporal variation in ﬁnes on excess fertility as instruments for fertility outcome, I find that Chinese senior parents with more children receive more financial transfer and are more likely to co-reside with economically independent children. Interestingly, the effects of number of children and gender of children are significantly different between urban and rural area. By considering “exchange-for-service” motive of transfer potentially correlated with number of children, the estimated effects are still large and significant. In addition, this paper discusses social pension insurance as an alternative to home-grown pension plans.</div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">  This paper examines the effect of heating on air polution. By first-differencing air pollutants and air quality index before and after the timing of heating, we find robust evidence that heating has a negative effect on air quality in cities of North China. </div></p>

      Motivation
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Motivation: It is commonly seen in chinese middle and high school that students are educated in unparallel classes, for example, experimental classes and ordinary classes. This paper aims to examine this policy effect on educational outcome. Regression discontinuity design is super suitable to this setting where students are classified according to their performence in an exam. I also tries to investigate what explains this difference (if any). Several hypothesis are examined: (i) peer-quality effect; (ii) teacher-quality effect; and (iii) self-investment effect.</div></p>

    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>Macroeconomic Announcement and Threshold Effect on Risk Premium and Stock Return</b> <br> <button class="accordion">
      Motivation
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Over the past decade, China economy has went through a speed-down. The voice of keeping the GDP growth above some certain threshold can be heard everytime the economic growth tend to slip into a lower rate. For example, when GDP growth in third quater of 2019 is announced to be 6.0%, the controvercy is immediately aroused whether is necessary to keep growth rate above 6%. One argument of proponents is that 6% is an important threshhold for expectation.</div></p>
